predictions.py
The code which shows my workings from start to finish. It is separated into steps. Each step explores something new (e.g. different pre-processing or something else to improve accuracy). Each step has shows an accuracy score as a result of implementing that step. If the accuracy is reduced, generally that step will not be included in the final code.
