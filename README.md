predictions.py:
The code which shows my workings from start to finish. It is separated into steps. Each step explores something new (e.g. different pre-processing or something else to improve accuracy). Each step has shows an accuracy score as a result of implementing that step. If the accuracy is reduced, generally that step will not be included in the final code.

final.py:
Final processing and prediction, based on what was learnt in predictions.py

data: contains the raw data as well as the predictions made. Predictions are named with the step number (for the step that generated the prediction) and a very short description about what was done differently in that step.

plots: contains a few plots that were generated in the exploration phase.
